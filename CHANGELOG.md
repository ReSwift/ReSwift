# Upcoming

**Breaking API Changes:**
- Remove `StandardAction` and `StandardActionConvertible` (#270) - @mjarvis
    
    - The existence of `StandardAction` and `StandardActionConvertible` is somewhat confusing to new users, and does not have a direct use case within the core ReSwift library. Therefore, it has been moved to [ReSwift-Recorder](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift-Recorder) where it belongs.
    - If you're using `StandardAction` in your project without `ReSwift-Recorder`, you can copy the old implementation into your project as a middle ground while you migrate away from its usage.

**Other**:
- Add Subscription `skip(when:)` and `only(when:)` (#242) - @mjarvis
- Add `automaticallySkipsRepeats` configuration option to Store initializer (#262) - @DivineDominion
- Fix retain cycle in SubscriptionBox (#278) - @mjarvis, @DivineDominion

# 4.0.0

*Released: 4/19/2017*

**Breaking API Changes:**

- Introduced a new Subscription API (#203) - @Ben-G, @mjarvis, @DivineDominion

  - The subscription API provides basic operators, such as `skipRepeats` (skip calls to `newState` unless state value changed) and `select` (sub-select a state).

  - This is a breaking API change that requires migrating existing subscriptions that sub-select a portion of a store's state:

    - Subselecting state in 3.0.0:

      ```swift
      store.subscribe(subscriber) { ($0.testValue, $0.otherState?.name) }
      ```
    - Subselecting state in 4.0.0:

      ```swift
      store.subscribe(subscriber) {
        $0.select {
          ($0.testValue, $0.otherState?.name)
        }
      }
      ```

  - For any store state that is `Equatable` or any sub-selected state that is `Equatable`, `skipRepeats` will be used by default.

  - For states/substates that are not `Equatable`, `skipRepeats` can be implemented via a closure:

    ```swift
    store.subscribe(subscriber) {
      $0.select {
          $0.testValue
          }.skipRepeats {
              return $0 == $1
          }
    }
    ```

- Reducer type has been removed in favor of reducer function (#177) - Ben-G

  - Here's an example of a new app reducer, for details see the README:

    ```swift
    func counterReducer(action: Action, state: AppState?) -> AppState {
        var state = state ?? AppState()

        switch action {
        case _ as CounterActionIncrease:
            state.counter += 1
        case _ as CounterActionDecrease:
            state.counter -= 1
        default:
            break
        }

        return state
    }
    ```

- `dispatch` functions now return `Void` instead of `Any` (#187) - @Qata

  - The return type has been removed without any replacement, since the core team did not find any use cases of it. A common usage of the return type in redux is returning a promise that is fullfilled when a dispatched action is processed. While it's generally discouraged to disrupt the unidirectional data flow using this mechanism we do provide a `dispatch` overload that takes a `callback` argument and serves this purpose.

- Make `dispatch` argument in middleware non-optional (#225) -  @dimazen, @mjarvis, @Ben-G

- `Middleware` now has a generic type parameter that is used for the `getState` method and matches the Store's `State` type. This allows accessing the state in middleware code without type casting (#226) - @mjarvis
