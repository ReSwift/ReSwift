 Defines the interface of Stores in ReSwift. `Store` is the default implementation of this
 interface. Applications have a single store that stores the entire application state.
 Stores receive actions and use reducers combined with these actions, to calculate state changes.
 Upon every state update a store informs all of its subscribers.
