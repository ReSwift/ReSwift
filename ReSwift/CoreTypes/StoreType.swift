 Defines the interface of Stores in ReSwift. `Store` is the default implementation of this

     Dispatches an action creator to the store. Action creators are functions that generate
     actions. They are called by the store and receive the current state of the application
     and a reference to the store as their input.

     Based on that input the action creator can either return an action or not. Alternatively
     the action creator can also perform an asynchronous operation and dispatch a new action
     at the end of it.

     Example of an action creator:

     ```
     func deleteNote(noteID: Int) -> ActionCreator {
        return { state, store in
            // only delete note if editing is enabled
            if (state.editingEnabled == true) {
                return NoteDataAction.DeleteNote(noteID)
            } else {
                return nil
            }
        }
     }
     ```

     This action creator can then be dispatched as following:

     ```
     store.dispatch( noteActionCreatore.deleteNote(3) )
     ```

     - returns: By default returns the dispatched action, but middlewares can change the
     return type, e.g. to return promises
