 Defines the interface of Stores in Swift Flow. `MainStore` is the default implementation of this

 Stores receive actions and use reducers combined with these actions, to calculate state changes.

    /**
     Dispatches an action creator to the store. Action creators are functions that generate
     actions. They are called by the store and receive the current state of the application
     and a reference to the store as their input.

     Based on that input the action creator can either return an action or not. Alternatively
     the action creator can also perform an asynchronous operation and dispatch a new action
     at the end of it.

     Example of an action creator:

     ```
     func deleteNote(noteID: Int) -> ActionCreator {
        return { state, store in
            // only delete note if editing is enabled
            if (state.editingEnabled == true) {
                return NoteDataAction.DeleteNote(noteID)
            } else {
                return nil
            }
        }
     }
     ```

     This action creator can then be dispatched as following:

     ```
     store.dispatch( noteActionCreatore.deleteNote(3) )
     ```

     - returns: By default returns the dispatched action, but middlewares can change the
     return type, e.g. to return promises

     triggered by the asynchronously generated action creator.

     This overloaded version of `dispatch` calls the provided `callback` as soon as the
     asynchronoously dispatched action has caused a new state calculation.

     a successful login). However, you should try to use this callback very seldom as it
     deviates slighlty from the unidirectional data flow principal.
