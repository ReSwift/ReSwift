/// Implements the abstract `Observable.subscribe` to release resources upon disposal.
/// Delegates the actual grunt work of connecting an event sequence to an observer to
/// subclasses that implement `run(_:)`.
///
/// Notable examples:
///
/// - `Observable.create` uses `ObservableEventSource` to produce events at the beginning of
///    an event sequence. This is the root of all subscriptions.
/// - Operators like `Select` take an existing sequence and connect their transformers to it
///   in `run(_:)`, *producing* a resulting sequence.
