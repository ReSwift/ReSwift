 A Reducer that combines multiple reducers into one. You will typically use this reducer during
 initial store setup:

 ```swift
 let reducer = CombinedReducer([IncreaseByOneReducer(), IncreaseByTwoReducer()])
 Store(reducer: reducer, appState: CounterState())
 ```

 The order of the reducers in the array is the order in which the reducers will be invoked.
