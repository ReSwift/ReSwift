/**
 This class is the default implementation of the `StoreType` protocol. You will use this store in most
 of your applications. You shouldn't need to implement your own store.
 You initialize the store with a reducer and an initial application state. If your app has multiple
 reducers you can combine them by initializng a `MainReducer` with all of your reducers as an
 argument.
