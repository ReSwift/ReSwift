 This is ReSwift's built in action type, it is the only built in type that conforms to the
 `Action` protocol. `StandardAction` can be serialized and can therefore be used with developer
 tools that restore state between app launches.

 The downside of `StandardAction` is that it carries its payload as an untyped dictionary which does
 not play well with Swift's type system.

 It is recommended that you define your own types that conform to `Action` - if you want to be able
 to serialize your custom action types, you can implement `StandardActionConvertible` which will
 make it possible to generate a `StandardAction` from your typed action - the best of both worlds!
