    /**
     Dispatches an action creator to the store. Action creators are functions that generate
     actions. They are called by the store and receive the current state of the application
     and a reference to the store as their input.

     Based on that input the action creator can either return an action or not. Alternatively
     the action creator can also perform an asynchronous operation and dispatch a new action
     at the end of it.

     Example of an action creator:
     ```swift
     func deleteNote(noteID: Int) -> ActionCreator {
        return { state, store in
            // only delete note if editing is enabled
            if (state.editingEnabled == true) {
                return NoteDataAction.DeleteNote(noteID)
            } else {
                return nil
            }
        }
     }
     ```

     This action creator can then be dispatched as following:
     ```swift
     store.dispatch( noteActionCreatore.deleteNote(3) )
     ```

     - returns: By default returns the dispatched action, but middlewares can change the
     return type, e.g. to return promises

     */
    func dispatch(asyncActionCreatorProvider: AsyncActionCreator)

    /**
     Dispatches an action and calls the callback as soon as the action has been processed.

     Example of dispatching an action and implementing a callback:

     store.dispatch( CounterAction.IncreaseCounter ) { state in
        print("New state: \(state)")
