# CocoaPods is used only to fetch and pin the version of SwiftLint that we want
# to use in the project. The Podfile DSL (at the time of CP 1.2.0) requires
# pods to be defined within a target. To work with that without having to make
# any of the actual ReSwift targets dirty or bloated a dummy target called
# SwiftLintIntegration has been added.
target 'SwiftLintIntegration' do
  pod 'SwiftLint'
